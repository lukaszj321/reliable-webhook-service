# Webhook Delivery Execution

The application provides a synchronous service that executes one webhook delivery and persists one
completed `WebhookDeliveryAttempt`.

## Current execution model

Delivery execution is synchronous. One call performs at most one HTTP request, and every request
that is actually executed ends with an attempt to persist one completed delivery attempt. The
service does not retry requests, and creating a webhook event does not trigger delivery
automatically.

## Preparation and validation

Before making a request, the service:

1. reads the `WebhookEvent`;
2. reads the associated `WebhookEndpoint`;
3. checks that the endpoint is active;
4. reads the maximum existing `attempt_number` for the event;
5. prepares the event ID, target URL, payload, and next attempt number.

Preparation can raise these application errors:

- `Webhook event not found`
- `Webhook endpoint not found`
- `Webhook endpoint is inactive`

These errors occur before the HTTP request and do not create a delivery attempt.

## HTTP request behavior

The service sends the event payload as JSON in a `POST` request to the endpoint's exact
`target_url`. The caller supplies an explicit timeout, which must be positive and finite. Redirects
are disabled with `follow_redirects=False`.

Each execution performs exactly one request. It does not retry, and it does not read or persist the
response body.

## Result classification

| Result | `outcome` | `response_status_code` | `error_message` |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP 200-299 | `succeeded` | Actual response status | `null` |
| Other HTTP status | `failed` | Actual response status | `HTTP response returned status {status_code}` |
| Timeout | `failed` | `null` | `Webhook request timed out` |
| Other `RequestError` | `failed` | `null` | `Webhook request failed: {ExceptionClassName}` |

Exception text, response bodies, and tracebacks are not persisted.

## Attempt persistence

The service persists these fields:

- `event_id`
- `attempt_number`
- `outcome`
- `target_url`
- `response_status_code`
- `error_message`
- `duration_ms`
- `attempted_at`

`target_url` is a snapshot of the URL used for the request. `duration_ms` uses a monotonic
measurement and cannot be negative. `attempted_at` must be timezone-aware.

After committing and refreshing the attempt, the service returns the persisted ORM object. A
commit or refresh error causes a rollback and re-raises the exception. Persistence does not solve
concurrent execution for the same event.

## Attempt numbering

The first attempt for an event has number 1. Each later attempt uses the maximum existing number
for that event plus 1; attempts for other events do not affect it. A database unique constraint
protects the pair of `event_id` and `attempt_number`.

Concurrent attempt-number allocation remains outside the current scope.

## Error handling

- Preparation errors occur before the request and do not create an attempt.
- Expected delivery failures, including non-2xx responses and transport errors, create a completed
  `failed` attempt.
- An invalid timeout is not caught and does not create an attempt.
- An invalid naive attempt timestamp prevents the request and does not create an attempt.
- A database commit or refresh error rolls back the transaction and re-raises the exception.

## Invocation

`execute_webhook_delivery` is currently called directly from application code. No public HTTP
endpoint starts a delivery. `POST /webhook-events` only stores an event and does not call the
delivery service. The delivery-attempt listing API only reads previously stored attempts.

## Current limitations

- No automatic delivery trigger
- No background processing
- No retry or backoff
- No replay
- No idempotency
- No concurrent attempt-number allocation
- No request signing
- No custom headers
- No public execution API
- No response body persistence
